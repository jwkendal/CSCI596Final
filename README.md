# CSCI 596 Final Project
For my final project, I created a simulation of air molecules in python. 

# Design
To achieve this, I used object oriented programming principles to create to create this simulation. There is a Simulation class that holds a list of all the particles in the
simulation, along with various functions to perform the necessary operations on each iteration of the simulation. I also made Particle class, which holds information about a particle such as its 
position, velocity, temperature, kinetic energy, and information about any collisions that may have occured this iteration. This class also houses any necessary functions to update
the particle's temperature and kinetic energy after a collision.

This simulation begins by reading in data from a config file called "sim.in". This file contains input values detailed in the "Inputs" section below, and the simulation class
initializes an instance of itself using these inputs. After initialization, the "simData" pandas dataframe is created, which will store all the data throughout the simulation.
This dataframe will be converted to a .csv and a .xyz file at the end of the simulation loop.

Once the dataframe is created and filled with initial data, the simulation begins its main loop. It will iterate until the simulation time reaches the specified end time of the 
sim, with time steps between iterations being specified as an input. On each iteration, the simulation calculates new positions for each particle, and checks to see if any collisions
have occured with either the boundary of the sim, or with another particle. In the event of a particle collision, calculations are performed to determine the new velocities of
each involved particle based on the principles of a completely elastic collision (i.e. momentum and energy are conserved).

Once the simulation has completed it's loop, the data stored inside the "simData" dataframe is output to .csv file, and then output to a .xyz file for visualization purposes.

# Inputs
There are 10 input parameters to this simulation, which are as follows:
  - **numParticles**: the number of particles to use in this simulation
  - **size**: the length of the cube (in meters) to perform this simulation in
  - **timeStep**: the time step (in seconds) between each iteration of the simulation
  - **endTime**: the time (in seconds) to stop the simulation at (start time is always 0)
  - **highTemp**: the higher temperature (in Kelvin) to initialize particles at
  - **lowTemp**: the lower temperature (in Kelvin) to initialize the particles at
  - **tempHighPct**: the percentage of particles to initialize at the higher temperature
  - **tempLowPct**: the percentage of particles to initialize at the lower temperature
  - **outputFile**: the filepath of the .csv file you wish to output data from the simulation to
  - **xyzOutputFile**: the filepath of the .xyz file you wish to output data from the simulation to

# Outputs
There are 2 output files generated by the simulation. 

The first is a .csv file, which contains the information for every particle at every iteration of the simulation. This information includes:
  - simulation time [s]
  - particle ID
  - position [m]
  - velocity [m/s]
  - temperature [K]
  - kinetic energy [J]
  - Whether any collisions occured
  - Which particles it collided with  (-1 if none)

The second is a .xyz file, which contains the position in XYZ coordinates of every particle at each time iteration. This file is intended for use in VMD, to display the 
particles and their movement after the simulation is over.

# Results
After outputting the position of each particle into the XYZ file, I was able to load the results of the simulation into VMD. I generated the following video using 27 particles 
in a 0.1 meter space:
